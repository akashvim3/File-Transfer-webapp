A modern, full-featured file transfer application that provides both server-based file sharing and peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer capabilities. Built with Node.js and WebRTC, this application offers a seamless, secure, and efficient way to share files across devices and networks.
Key Highlights

    üöÄ Dual Transfer Modes: Server-based sharing and direct P2P transfer
    üì± Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
    üîí Secure Transfers: Encrypted P2P connections and unique file links
    ‚ö° Real-time Updates: Live progress tracking and status notifications
    üéØ Multiple File Support: Compatible with all file types

Usage Guide
Server-based File Sharing

    Navigate to Upload Tab
        Click on the "Upload & Share" tab in the interface
    Select File
        Drag and drop a file onto the upload area
        Or click the upload area to open file browser
    Upload & Share
        Click "Upload & Share" button
        Monitor the upload progress
        Copy the generated shareable link
    Share the Link
        Send the link to recipients
        Recipients can download the file directly

Peer-to-Peer Transfer

    Access P2P Tab
        Switch to the "P2P Transfer" tab
    Create/Join Room
        Enter a unique Room ID on both devices
        Wait for connection to establish
    Transfer Files
        Once connected, drag and drop files to transfer
        Monitor transfer progress in real-time

API Documentation
File Upload Endpoint

POST /upload

Upload a file to the server.

Headers:

Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:

file: [File object]

Response:

json

{
  "success": true,
  "filename": "unique-filename.ext",
  "downloadLink": "/download/unique-filename.ext",
  "originalName": "original-filename.ext",
  "size": 1024
}

File Download Endpoint

GET /download/:filename

Download a previously uploaded file.

Parameters:

    filename: The unique filename returned from upload

Architecture
Backend Components

    Express.js: Web server framework
    Socket.IO: Real-time bidirectional communication
    Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data
    UUID: Unique identifier generation
    Helmet: Security middleware

Frontend Components

    WebRTC: Peer-to-peer communication protocol
    Socket.IO Client: Real-time communication with server
    Modern CSS: CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables
    Progressive Enhancement: Works without JavaScript for basic features

WebRTC Signaling Flow

    B->>S: Join Room

    B->>S: WebRTC Answer
    S->>A: WebRTC Answer
    A<->>B: Direct P2P Connection

Security Considerations
Server-based Security

    Files are stored with UUID-based names to prevent guessing
    CORS configured for cross-origin security
    File size limits to prevent abuse
    Automatic file cleanup (configurable)

P2P Security

    WebRTC provides end-to-end encryption
    Room-based isolation prevents unauthorized access
    No data passes through server during transfer
    ICE candidates for NAT traversal

Browser Compatibility

Browser	Server Mode	P2P Mode
Chrome 60+	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
Firefox 55+	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
Edge 79+	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
Safari 12+	‚úÖ	‚ö†Ô∏è (Limited)

Note: P2P mode requires WebRTC support. Some mobile browsers may have limitations.
Performance Optimization
Server Mode

    Chunked file upload for large files
    Progress throttling to prevent UI flooding
    Automatic cleanup of old files

P2P Mode

    Efficient data channel configuration
    Adaptive bitrate based on connection quality
    Connection reliability monitoring

Troubleshooting
Common Issues

Upload fails with large files

    Check MAX_FILE_SIZE environment variable
    Verify server disk space

P2P connection fails

    Ensure both devices are on compatible networks
    Check firewall settings
    Try different STUN/TURN servers

Files not accessible after upload

    Verify uploads directory permissions
    Check file system disk space

FAQ

Q: Is there a file size limit? A: Yes, configurable through MAX_FILE_SIZE environment variable (default: 100MB)

Q: How long are files stored on the server? A: Files can be configured to auto-delete after a specified time (see configuration)

Q: Are P2P transfers secure? A: Yes, WebRTC provides end-to-end encryption

Q: Can I use this behind a corporate firewall? A: Yes, but you may need to configure STUN/TURN servers for P2P mode
